# Skin Cancer Classification

Integration of deep learning into medical imaging opened up new horizons for disease detection and diagnosis. With artificial intelligence, we can now detect diseases at their earliest stages, greatly improving the chances of successful treatment. In this project, I use machine learning for identification and classification of different types of skin cancer.
